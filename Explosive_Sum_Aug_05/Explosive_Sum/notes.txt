How To Implement Explosive Sum-
        options: 
            -looping through each iteration of x Number (dont want to do this, program will take to long to process for larger numbers)
            -[WORK IN PROGRESS]Matrix Calculation (currently thinking of a solution to fill out matrix and callback to any outputs)
            -Recursion could work, only concern is memory for larger numbers.

    Main Issue:
        Figuring out what algorithm to implement/how to implement.



Log:  9:30am    Started Working. Implemented initial code, read through instructions and tried figuring out how the problem workds.
     10:10am    Came Up With Personal_Notes.png as Possible Solution. Stopped for break.
     10:40am    Started Working. Trying to figure out how to implement Personal_Notes.png.
     11:30am    Trying to find a way to implement dynamic programming. (Im really struggling on coming up with a coding solution).
                    -might need a refresher on dynamic programming.
                Taking a break. (comeback and relearn on how to implement dynamic programming)

How To Implement Explosive Sum-
        options: 
            -looping through each iteration of x Number (dont want to do this, program will take to long to process for larger numbers)
            -[WORK IN PROGRESS]Matrix Calculation (currently thinking of a solution to fill out matrix and callback to any outputs)
            -Recursion could work, only concern is memory for larger numbers.

    Main Issue:
        Figuring out what algorithm to implement/how to implement.

I Will Be Committing My CodeWars Solutions Here.
This Is Meant To Log My Progress And Help Me Practice My Coding.

Expecting Most Of My Early Programming Solutions To Take Longer To Solve.

By Logging My Progress With Each Problems, I Hope I'm Able To Solve Problems In A Timely Matter, By Fixing My Weak Spots In Problem Solving/Coding Practices.

In CodeWars, kyu, Ranked From 1 To 8, Is How Difficult The Problems Are. 1 Being The Hardest and 8 Being The Easiest.
The Only Way To Rank Up Is By Completing Problems In Your Current Rank Or Higher (Higher Meaning The Difficulty).

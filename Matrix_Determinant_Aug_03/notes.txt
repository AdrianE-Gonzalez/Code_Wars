Used Recursion To Solve This Problem.
Took About 2.5 Hours To Solve This, Give Or Take.

Main Issues I Had:
    -Trying To Figure Out How Determinant Worked For NxN Dimensions, Where  N > 3.
        -Once I Figured This Out, I Knew To Properly Implement Recursion.
    -Didn't Remember How To Initialize Empty 2D Vector. (Wasn't Sure How This Worked Exactly Because I've Been Working With Python)


Notes For Next Problem:
    -Commit To GitHub Each Step Of The Solution. (To Show My Progression)
    -Maybe Write Down Each Issue/Question When Stuck. (Helps Me Understand What I'm Struggling With)
